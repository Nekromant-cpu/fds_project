1501125427,"An updated and revised edition of the controversial classic—now more relevant than ever—argues that boys are the ones languishing socially and academically, resulting in staggering social and economic costs.  Girls and women were once second-class citizens in the nation’s schools. Americans responded with concerted efforts to give girls and women the attention and assistance that was long overdue. Now, after two major waves of feminism and decades of policy reform, women have made massive strides in education. Today they outperform men in nearly every measure of social, academic, and vocational well-being.  Christina Hoff Sommers contends that it’s time to take a hard look at present-day realities and recognize that boys need help. Called “provocative and controversial...impassioned and articulate” (The Christian Science Monitor), this edition of The War Against Boys offers a new preface and six radically revised chapters, plus updates on the current status of boys throughout the book.  Sommers argues that the problem of male underachievement is persistent and worsening. Among the new topics Sommers tackles: how the war against boys is harming our economic future, and how boy-averse trends such as the decline of recess and zero-tolerance disciplinary policies have turned our schools into hostile environments for boys. As our schools become more feelings-centered, risk-averse, competition-free, and sedentary, they move further and further from the characteristic needs of boys. She offers realistic, achievable solutions to these problems that include boy-friendly pedagogy, character and vocational education, and the choice of single-sex classrooms.  Mehr lesen",200

151173731X,"Endorsed by evangelicals such as Steven J. Lawson, Thomas J. Nettles, Joel R. Beeke, John M. Frame, Justin Peters, and others, this is the record of the author's journey from an outspoken Arminian to a deeply devoted expositor of the biblical and historical Doctrines of Sovereign Grace. Several years in the making, this 360-page book is unique from others for two reasons: it is from a former passionate Arminian who knows those arguments well, and it treats these doctrines in an expositional manner instead of the usual topical fashion. After laying the all important foundation of how we should approach these doctrines, it then exposits the classic passages of Scripture that present them. A very special chapter, “The Test of History (Jude 3),” carefully traces the history of both Arminianism and Calvinism, demonstrating the consequences of both and the historical orthodoxy of the latter.",200
B008H75CKQ,"These volumes on Napoleon are not a history of his era. The two now issued are confined to the second half of the military life of the great captain, and are the concluding volumes of the History of the Art of War, begun by the author in 1890 with the life of A lexander. Political events are barely touched on ;personal matters only to throw light on Napoleon scharacter as a soldier. While narrating in much detail the campaigns from 1808 to 1815, Volumes III. and IV. furnish a study of the causes which led to Napoleon sdownfall, as Volumes I. and II. contain the story of his amazing rise to power. Although a part of the larger History, yet this military life of Napoleon is of itself a complete work. The subject is so vast that to write double the number of pages would have been far easier. To compress the matter into its present size has obliged the author to sacrifice diction to facts, and to reduce many chapters to what appears crude. All useless words, such, e. g., as titles, have been omitted. Son Altesse Snrissime le Prince Conntable becomes merely Berthier; Ney is not even Marshal Ney, much less Duke of Elchingen or Prince of the Moskwa; the Duke of A uerstadt and Prince of Eggmiihl remains plain Davout. Even in translating from the Correspondence, the well-known names of Lannes, or Soult, or Massena are retained instead of their more picturesque titles of nobility Adjectives have been erased wholesale.

This reformation is still incomplete, for it remains true today that despite the proliferation of techniques and schools, we do not know which are more correct or more successful--and all psychoanalysts continue to encounter intractable cases of mental disorder. Balint argues that ordinary ""rigid"" techniques and theories are doomed to failure in such cases because of their emphasis on interpretation.  The Basic Fault continues to illuminate the crucial current issues in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy in general: the nature of self, the role of developmental defects, the value of empathy, and the central importance of the relationship between therapist and patient.

Tucked away in the Hebrew Psalter, Peterson discovered ""an old dog-eared songbook,"" the Songs of Ascents that were sung by pilgrims on their way up to worship in Jerusalem. In these songs (Psalms 120-134) Peterson finds encouragement for modern pilgrims as we learn to grow in worship, service, joy, work, happiness, humility, community and blessing.

At a time when the center-right, religious-conservative leadership of the Justice and Development Party has dominated government and the political scene in Turkey—so much so that the democratic credentials of the regime have come into question—many have sought to understand what undergirds this party’s success at the polls. While many scholars have argued that elections in Turkey over time can be effectively and simply explained by static social or cultural cleavages, Wuthrich challenges these assertions with a framework that carefully attends to patterns of strategic vote-getting behavior in elections by political parties and their leaders. Using the campaign speeches of the political elite, election data at national and provincial levels, and careful observations of voter mobilization strategies across time, Wuthrich traces four distinct patterns that explain important shifts in electoral behavior. He covers the first free and fair multiparty election in 1950 and follows campaign strategies through 2011, highlighting and explaining the potential development of a new and more problematic paradigm emerging in the post-2007 environment.",200

0520283902,"Funnybooks is the story of the most popular American comic books of the 1940s and 1950s, those published under the Dell label. For a time, “Dell Comics Are Good Comics” was more than a slogan―it was a simple statement of fact. Many of the stories written and drawn by people like Carl Barks (Donald Duck, Uncle Scrooge), John Stanley (Little Lulu), and Walt Kelly (Pogo) repay reading and rereading by educated adults even today, decades after they were published as disposable entertainment for children. Such triumphs were improbable, to say the least, because midcentury comics were so widely dismissed as trash by angry parents, indignant librarians, and even many of the people who published them. It was all but miraculous that a few great cartoonists were able to look past that nearly universal scorn and grasp the artistic potential of their medium. With clarity and enthusiasm, Barrier explains what made the best stories in the Dell comic books so special. He deftly turns a complex and detailed history into an expressive narrative sure to appeal to an audience beyond scholars and historians.",200

1935202855,"Published on the occasion of the first major survey of Barry McGee’s work, this monumental volume records more than two decades of incredible fecundity, over the course of which McGee has pioneered a new iconography of sharp street vitality and graphic snap. McGee began as a graffiti artist on the streets of San Francisco, working under such tags as Ray Fong, Twist and Twisto, and his work since then has hugely expanded the terms of both street art and contemporary art. The freshness of McGee’s work stems in part from his virtuoso handling and consolidation of a whole panoply of influences, from hobo art, sign painting and graffiti to comics, Beat literature and much else. His extraordinary skill as a draughtsman is energized by his insistence on pushing at the parameters of art--his work can be shockingly informal in the gallery and surprisingly elegant on the street--and by his keen nose for social malaise. This volume revisits McGee’s most influential installations in art spaces, and considers the evolution of his aesthetic within institutional settings. Previously unseen photographs by Craig Costello document the artist’s work on the streets of San Francisco in the early 90s, highlighting the contributions of his friends and mentors. Also included are images from the artist’s famous slide lecture, compiled and refined over the past 20 years, and an oral history of the Bay Area’s Mission School by McGee’s friends, mentors and collaborators. Featuring 450 images, including many never before published, the book is designed by the artist in collaboration with Conny Purtill.",200

0195171071,"Each year, more than two million pilgrims from over 100 countries converge on the holy city of Mecca to reenact the ritual dramas that Muslims have been performing for centuries. Making the hajj is one of the most important duties in the life of a Muslim. The pilgrimage-and its impact on international politics-is enormous and growing every year, yet Westerners know virtually nothing about it. What is the hajj and what does it mean? Who are the hajjis? What do they do and say in Mecca and how do they interpret their experiences? Who runs the hajj and what are their political objectives? How does the hajj encourage international cooperation among Muslims and can it also promote harmony between Islam and the West? In Guests of God, Robert R. Bianchi seeks to answer these and many other questions. While it is first and foremost a religious festival, he shows, the hajj is also very much a political event. The Muslim world's leading multinational organization, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has established the first international regime explicitly devoted to pilgrimage. Every large Muslim nation has developed a comprehensive hajj policy and a powerful bureaucracy to enforce it. Yet, Bianchi argues, no authority- secular or religious, national or international-can really control the hajj. Pilgrims believe that they are entitled to travel freely to Mecca as ""Guests of God""-not as guests of any nation or organization that might wish to restrict or profit from their efforts to fulfill a fundamental religious obligation. Drawing on his personal experience as a pilgrim and a wealth of data gathered over the course of ten years of research, Bianchi has produced a fascinating look at the hajj filled with personal, candid stories from political and religious leaders and hajjis from all walks of life. A wide-ranging study of Islam, politics, and power, Mehr lesen",200
0307395812,"An untamed region teeming with snakes, alligators, and snapping turtles, with sausage and cracklins sold at every gas station, Cajun Country is a world unto itself. The heart of this area—the Acadiana region of Louisiana—is a tough land that funnels its spirit into the local cuisine. You can’t find more delicious, rustic, and satisfying country cooking than the dirty rice, spicy sausage, and fresh crawfish that this area is known for. It takes a homegrown guide to show us around the back roads of this particularly unique region, and in Real Cajun, James Beard Award–winning chef Donald Link shares his own rough-and-tumble stories of living, cooking, and eating in Cajun Country.  Link takes us on an expedition to the swamps and smokehouses and the music festivals, funerals, and holiday celebrations, but, more important, reveals the fish fries, étouffées, and pots of Granny’s seafood gumbo that always accompany them. The food now famous at Link’s New Orleans–based restaurants, Cochon and Herbsaint, has roots in the family dishes and traditions that he shares in this book. You’ll find recipes for Seafood Gumbo, Smothered Pork Roast over Rice, Baked Oysters with Herbsaint Hollandaise, Louisiana Crawfish Boudin, quick and easy Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits with Fig-Ginger Preserves, Bourbon-Soaked Bread Pudding with White and Dark Chocolate, and Blueberry Ice Cream made with fresh summer berries. Link throws in a few lagniappes to give you an idea of life in the bayou, such as strategies for a great trip to Jazz Fest, a what-not-to-do instructional on catching turtles, and all you ever (or never) wanted to know about boudin sausage. Colorful personal essays enrich every recipe and introduce his grandfather and friends as they fish, shrimp, hunt, and dance.  From the backyards where crawfish boils reign as the greatest of outdoor events to the white tablecloths of Link’s famed restaurants, Mehr lesen",200

1401940757,"In this mind-expanding work, physicist Amit Goswami, Ph.D., explores the world of human creativity—the ultimate source of joy and fulfillment—through the lens of quantum physics, and offers up a unique way to nurture and enhance your own creativity. According to quantum physics, reality occurs on two levels: possibility and actuality. Goswami uses this same duality to explore what he calls ""quantum thinking,"" which focuses on two levels of thinking—the conscious mind of actuality and the unconscious mind of possibility. He then poses questions that probe the wellspring of creation that exists in each of us. What is creativity? Can anyone be creative? What kinds of creativity are there? And through this inquiry, he lays out a guidebook for understanding the power of the mind to access creativity in a whole new way. Combining the art of creativity with the objectivity of science, Quantum Creativity uses empirical data to support this new method of thinking and outlines how to harness our innate abilities in order to live more creatively. In short, Goswami teaches you how to think quantum to be creative.",200
0691090394,"Game theory, the formalized study of strategy, began in the 1940s by asking how emotionless geniuses should play games, but ignored until recently how average people with emotions and limited foresight actually play games. This book marks the first substantial and authoritative effort to close this gap. Colin Camerer, one of the field's leading figures, uses psychological principles and hundreds of experiments to develop mathematical theories of reciprocity, limited strategizing, and learning, which help predict what real people and companies do in strategic situations. Unifying a wealth of information from ongoing studies in strategic behavior, he takes the experimental science of behavioral economics a major step forward. He does so in lucid, friendly prose.   Behavioral game theory has three ingredients that come clearly into focus in this book: mathematical theories of how moral obligation and vengeance affect the way people bargain and trust each other; a theory of how limits in the brain constrain the number of steps of ""I think he thinks . . ."" reasoning people naturally do; and a theory of how people learn from experience to make better strategic decisions. Strategic interactions that can be explained by behavioral game theory include bargaining, games of bluffing as in sports and poker, strikes, how conventions help coordinate a joint activity, price competition and patent races, and building up reputations for trustworthiness or ruthlessness in business or life.   While there are many books on standard game theory that address the way ideally rational actors operate, Mehr lesen",200

0231119968,"The civil war in Algeria shows no sign of imminent resolution. Yet little has been written about the conflict, its various participants, and the opinions of Algerians―indeed, even about what exactly is being fought over. Restrictions on movement within Algeria have severely limited the ability of foreign journalists to analyze these issues, and there has been a paucity of firsthand accounts of how the conflict has played out across Algeria.  Now, one of Europe's leading authorities on contemporary Algerian politics has gained the kind of access necessary to present a clear, evenhanded account. The author interviewed residents in places in which few journalists have set foot: the impoverished suburbs of the major cities and the infamous ""Triangle of Death""―the stronghold of the Armed Islamic Group and the scene of some of the worst carnage. Rather than presenting a historical account, The Algerian Civil War focuses on the strategies employed by the war's main combatants, seeking to understand the significance of the conflict to all parties embroiled in it.",200
0062283251,"“Although the benefits of this study to scholars are obvious, this thought-provoking mixture of scholarly and colloquial will enlighten inquisitive general readers, too.” —  Library Journal (starred review) The classic study of the creative process from the bestselling author of Flow. Creativity is about capturing those moments that make life worth living. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (“The leading researcher into ‘flow states.’”  — Newsweek) reveals what leads to these moments—be it the excitement of the artist at the easel or the scientist in the lab—so that this knowledge can be used to enrich people's lives. Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process. He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the ""tortured genius"" is largely a myth. Most important, he explains why creativity needs to be cultivated and is necessary for the future of our country, if not the world.",200
0895264706,"HIV does not cause AIDS... AIDS is not sexually transmitted... AZT makes AIDS worse, not better... So argues Dr. Peter Duesberg, one of the world's leading microbiologists, a pioneer in the discovery of the HIV family of viruses, and member of the National Academy of Sciences. Duesberg's evidence - revealed in top scientific journals but kept out of the mainstream press - raises questions the AIDS research establishment has so far declined to answer: If HIV causes AIDS, why have thousands of AIDS victims never had HIV? Why have hundreds of thousands who have had HIV - for many years - remained perfectly healthy? Why does the discoverer of the HIV virus now claim it can not be the sole cause of AIDS? Why has more than ten years of AIDS research - costing tens of billions of dollars - failed to show how (or even if) HIV causes AIDS or attacks the immune system? With annual federal funding at more than $7 billion, AIDS research is better funded than any other disease - including cancer. Yet it has also produced the least results? Why? Duesberg explains how the lure of money and prestige, combined with powerful political pressures, have tempted otherwise responsible scientists to overlook - even suppress - major flaws in current AIDS theory. The answer? Not more funding for more flawed research. Instead, start with an open airing of all the facts and failures, then determine the real cause of the disease. This book does both. For Duesberg's solution to the AIDS mystery is as convincing as his critique of the HIV theory - and could have save hundreds of thousands of lives at risk today. Mehr lesen",200

1861892829,"On a long stretch of green coast in the South Pacific, hundreds of enormous, impassive stone heads stand guard against the ravages of time, war, and disease that have attempted over the centuries to conquer Easter Island. Steven Roger Fischer offers the first English-language history of Easter Island in Island at the End of the World, a fascinating chronicle of adversity, triumph, and the enduring monumentality of the island's stone guards.  A small canoe with Polynesians brought the first humans to Easter Island in 700 CE, and when boat travel in the South Pacific drastically decreased around 1500, the Easter Islanders were forced to adapt in order to survive their isolation. Adaptation, Fischer asserts, was a continuous thread in the life of Easter Island: the first European visitors, who viewed the awe-inspiring monolithic busts in 1722, set off hundreds of years of violent warfare, trade, and disease—from the smallpox, wars, and Great Death that decimated the island to the late nineteenth-century Catholic missionaries who tried to ""save"" it to a despotic Frenchman who declared sole claim of the island and was soon killed by the remaining 111 islanders. The rituals, leaders, and religions of the Easter Islanders evolved with all of these events, and Fischer is just as attentive to the island's cultural developments as he is to its foreign invasions.  Bringing his history into the modern era, Fischer examines the colonization and annexation of Easter Island by Chile, including the Rapanui people's push for civil rights in 1964 and 1965, by which they gained full citizenship and freedom of movement on the island. As travel to and interest in the island rapidly expand, Mehr lesen",200

Nobody would expect to die of cyanide poisoning after eating an almond cake - but if you tell them there is cyanide in it, they might think at least twice about eating it. Do you know that you are spreading an aerosol of Camphylobacter bacteria around your kitchen and on other food that may lay around - and thus creating possibly life-threatening toxins - just by washing an oven-ready chicken from the supermarket before roasting it? The author, Ian Shaw, PhD, discusses all these and many other important problems and questions - ranging from GM food to natural toxins - in his easily understandable, passionate, yet authoritative and informative book. But in contrast to many other authors, Ian Shaw sets the risks of food, foodborne pathogens and food contaminats in the context of life’s risks. Enjoyment of food and eating is a benefit that far outweighs the risks, at least if everybody is aware of those risks and uses measures to minimize them.",200

Hockey Confidential is Bob’s all-access pass to the NHL. In addition to revealing the actual stats that NHL coaches and scouts use, Hockey Confidential is also about the value of family within a hockey context. An 80-yearold Don Cherry sharing precious moments with his son, Tim, at the rink; rock star Gord Downie of the Tragically Hip communing with his brothers in a lifelong love affair with the Boston Bruins; the patriarchs of the Subban and Tavares families emigrating from Jamaica and Portugal, respectively, to become household hockey names and raise great Canadian superstars; to say nothing of a teenaged Connor McDavid, leaning on his family and support system, including the incomparable Bobby Orr, to help cope with the pressures of being tabbed as the Next Big Thing in hockey; as well as Sheldon Keefe’s dramatic personal struggle to leave behind a dark and troubled past to become a better man, son, brother, husband, father and hockey coach.

0449905896,"Long before there was pharmacology as we know it, the North American Indians cured illness and maintained health by natural means, using the healing plants of the forest, desert, and seashore. Their discoveries continue to have impact on modern medicine: over 25 percent of all prescription drugs contain plant derivatives, and the mainstream medical establishment is acknowledging the effectiveness of herbal remedies in treating certain illnesses.  Earth Medicine, Earth Food is an A-to-Z reference to the plant remedies and wild foods used by the Indians. Organized by condition -- from allergies to female complaints to wounds -- it explains which plants were used by different tribes to treat specific maladies, how they were prepared, and how to identify them in the wild. You'll learn that: -- The Catawba Indians treated back pain with a tea of arnica roots -- The Iroquois and Mohegans used the boneset weed for colds and fever -- The Blackfoot Indians applied a paste of scarlet mallow to burns as a cooling agent -- The Menominees cured insomnia with a tea steeped from the leaves of the partridge berry plant -- The Onondagas drank pennyroyal tea for headache  Earth Medicine, Earth Food also discusses non-animal food sources consumed by the Indians such as nuts, seeds, berries, and ferns, and examines the relevance of traditional dietary patterns to the way we eat now.

1472812646,"The Douglas AD Skyraider is considered the most effective naval aircraft of the Korean War, overshadowed in fame by the new jet fighters that captured the public imagination. Too late for combat in World War II, the AD had replaced Dauntless, Helldiver, and Avenger dive- and torpedo-bombers from that conflict on carrier decks during the late 1940s and was on hand to react to the surprise North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950.  This book tells the story of the carrier-based U.S. Navy squadrons and the three land-based U.S. Marine Corps AD units that flew combat missions against the North Koreans and Chinese. Drawing from personal interviews with AD pilots, the authors paint a harrowing picture of the deadly combat of this often forgotten air war. Included in this volume are the AD night attack and electronic countermeasures crews who harassed the enemy lines of communications after dark. Supporting the text are a number of previously unpublished private photographs that bring the stories of these pilots to life. Finally, the book contains extensive appendices that detail every unit deployment by carrier, air group, Skyraider model, and tail code, as well as detailed lists noting every Skyraider lost in the war.",200

Once Anthony entered Iraq he discovered that hostilities and uncontrolled looting had devastated the zoo and its animals. Working with members of the zoo staff and a few compassionate U.S. soldiers, he defended the zoo, bartered for food on war-torn streets, and scoured bombed palaces for desperately needed supplies.

Born in Hamburg, the Venezuelan artist created her three-dimensional installations out of wire, ropes or aluminum bars, or sometimes with found materials such as clothes hangers or metal springs. Before emigrating in 1939, Gertrud Goldschmidt (Gego) studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart under Paul Bonatz, and, as a result, the construction of structures and the shaping of space took on great significance in her artistic work, which takes line as a theme in its own right.

1843763311,"Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital presents a novel interpretation of the good and bad times in the economy, taking a long-term perspective and linking technology and finance in an original and convincing way. Carlota Perez draws upon Schumpeter's theories of the clustering of innovations to explain why each technological revolution gives rise to a paradigm shift and a 'New Economy' and how these 'opportunity explosions', focused on specific industries, also lead to the recurrence of financial bubbles and crises. These findings are illustrated with examples from the past two centuries: the industrial revolution, the age of steam and railways, the age of steel and electricity, the emergence of mass production and automobiles, and the current information revolution/knowledge society. By analyzing the changing relationship between finance capital and production capital during the emergence, diffusion and assimilation of new technologies throughout the global economic system, this seminal book sheds new light on some of the most pressing economic problems of today. A bold interpretation of how the changing relationship between technological advances and financial capital shapes the patterns of economic cycles, this path-breaking book will provide essential insights for business leaders, policymakers, academics and others concerned with managing change in the world economy.

0300158343,"Why the public domain is vitally important and what we must do to protect it  In this enlightening book James Boyle describes what he calls the range wars of the information age—today’s heated battles over intellectual property. Boyle argues that just as every informed citizen needs to know at least something about the environment or civil rights, every citizen should also understand intellectual property law. Why? Because intellectual property rights mark out the ground rules of the information society, and today’s policies are unbalanced, unsupported by evidence, and often detrimental to cultural access, free speech, digital creativity, and scientific innovation. Boyle identifies as a major problem the widespread failure to understand the importance of the public domain—the realm of material that everyone is free to use and share without permission or fee. The public domain is as vital to innovation and culture as the realm of material protected by intellectual property rights, he asserts, and he calls for a movement akin to the environmental movement to preserve it. With a clear analysis of issues ranging from Jefferson’s philosophy of innovation to musical sampling, synthetic biology and Internet file sharing, this timely book brings a positive new perspective to important cultural and legal debates. If we continue to enclose the “commons of the mind,” Boyle argues, we will all be the poorer.  Mehr lesen",200

0137043775,"In business and investing, risk has traditionally been viewed negatively: investors and companies can lose money due to risk and therefore we typically penalize companies for taking risks. That’s why most books on risk management focus strictly on hedging or mitigating risk. But the enterprise’s relationship with risk should be far more nuanced. Great companies become great because they seek out and exploit intelligent risks, not because they avoid all risk. Strategic Risk Taking: A Framework for Risk Management is the first book to take this broader view, encompassing both risk hedging at one end of the spectrum and strategic risk taking on the other. World-renowned financial pioneer Aswath Damodaran–one of BusinessWeek’s top 12 business school professors–is singularly well positioned to take this strategic view. Here, Damodaran helps you separate good risk (opportunities) from bad risk (threats), showing how to utilize the former while protecting yourself against the latter. He introduces powerful financial tools for evaluating risk, and demonstrates how to draw on other disciplines to make these tools even more effective. Simply put, Damodaran has written the first book that helps you use risk to increase firm value, drive higher growth and returns, and create real competitive advantage. Mehr lesen",200

1590307291,"A prominent Insight Meditation teacher presents the Buddhist concept of “no-self” in an easy-to-understand way that will radically change your perspective on life  Anatta is the Buddhist teaching on the nonexistence of a permanent, independent self. It’s a notoriously puzzling and elusive concept, usually leading to such questions as, “If I don’t have a self, who’s reading this sentence?” It’s not that there’s no self there, says Rodney Smith. It’s just that the self that is reading this sentence is a configuration of elements that at one time did not exist and which at some point in the future will disperse. Even in its present existence, it’s more a temporary arrangement of components rather than something solid.  Anatta is a truth the Buddha considered to be absolutely essential to his teaching. Smith shows that understanding this truth can change the way you relate to the world, and that the perspective of selflessness is critically important for anyone involved in spiritual practice. Seeing it can be the key to getting past the idea that spirituality has something to do with self-improvement, and to accessing the joy of deep insight into reality.",200

Escaping a cheating ex, finance whiz Sara Dillon's moved to New York City and is looking for excitement without a lot of strings attached. So meeting the irresistible, sexy Brit at a dance club should have meant nothing more than a night's fun. But the manner--and speed--with which he melts her inhibitions turns him from a one-time hookup and into her Beautiful Stranger.  The whole city knows Max Stella loves women, not that he's ever found one he particularly wants to keep around. Despite pulling in plenty with his Wall Street bad boy charm, it's not until Sara--and the wild photos she lets him take of her--that he starts wondering if there's someone for him outside of the bedroom.  Hooking up in places where anybody could catch them, the only thing scarier for Sara than getting caught in public is having Max get too close in private.",200

0882906143,"The Endowment is a re-enactment of scriptural images and symbols. It is literally a gift - a gift of God's power. While carefully maintaining the sacred confidentiality of the temple ordinances, this book provides scriptural correlations which will open up rich new areas of understanding. Once you read this inspired information, you will be better informed about the scriptural authority and symbolism of the sacred ordinances. You will be better prepared and motivated to apply scriptural symbols in your life and strive to become more like Christ. Within these pages are more than twenty scriptural symbols which correlate with the temple service. The central focus of these symbols is found in Brigham Young's oft-quoted statement of the ceremony's ultimate purpose: to enable recipients to pass by the angelic sentinels who guard the entrance to God's kingdom as they ""walk back to the presence of the Father."" Endowed from on high teaches that revelation occurs during the endowment, that promises are required before blessings are granted, that covenants are the channels through which blessings flow, and that the Lord is voluntarily ""bound"" when we obey His commandments. This is a unique and reverential guide to growth in the most sacred of all areas of our relationship with the Savior and our heavenly Father.

1604690607,"Hostas are irresistible. Their sculptural leaves and appealing textures make it difficult to stop at one, and it is easy to fill a garden with them. Help is at hand with this attractive guide to the popular new small hostas that take up less space and are ideally suited to container cultivation. They can be used on their own or with companion plants to make charming displays on the patio, porch, or even windowsill. Many small hostas are simply scaled-down versions of classic hostas, while others offer distinctly new attributes in terms of color, leaf shape, and patterning. Like full-size hostas, small hostas can be upright, flat, or cascading; there are varieties that are full of substance, and others that are fine and delicate; there are green ones, gold ones, blue ones, variegated ones, and splashed ones. Some are better garden plants than others, and a valuable function of this book is to showcase the very best of the new introductions. Photographs of the hostas in garden settings show how admirably they respond to imaginative display in a wide range of situations including waterside, woodland, and rock gardens. Beautifully illustrated and highly informative, this handpicked selection of diminutive hostas will inspire hobbyists and gardeners alike and provide inspiration for new planting schemes.",200
0830827935,"On the basis of a theologically grounded understanding of the nature of persons and the self, Jack O. Balswick, Pamela Ebstyne King and Kevin S. Reimer present a model of human development that ranges across all of life's stages: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, middle adulthood, elder adulthood. They do this by drawing on a biblical model of relationality, where the created goal or purpose of human development is to become a reciprocating self--fully and securely related to others and to God. Along the way, they provide a context for understanding individual development issues--concerns, tensions, worries or crises encountered by the self in the context of change. Awareness of these issues is most pronounced at developmental transitional points: learning to talk and walk, beginning to eat unassisted, going to school, developing secondary sexual physical features, leaving home, obtaining full-time employment, becoming engaged and then married, having a child for the first time, parenting an adolescent, watching children move away from home, retiring, experiencing decline in physical and mental health, and, finally, facing imminent death. Throughout, Balswick, King and Reimer contend that, since God has created human beings for relationship, to be a self in reciprocating relationships is of major importance in negotiating these developmental issues. Critically engaging social science research and theory, The Reciprocating Self offers an integrated approach that provides insight helpful to college and seminary students as well as those serving in the helping professions. Those preparing for or currently engaged in Christian ministry will be especially rewarded by the in-depth discussion of the implications for moral and faith development nurtured in the context of the life of the church.

0262232278,"A sourcebook of historical written texts, video documentation, and working programs that form the foundation of new media. This reader collects the texts, videos, and computer programs—many of them now almost impossible to find—that chronicle the history and form the foundation of the still-emerging field of new media. General introductions by Janet Murray and Lev Manovich, along with short introductions to each of the texts, place the works in their historical context and explain their significance. The texts were originally published between World War II—when digital computing, cybernetic feedback, and early notions of hypertext and the Internet first appeared—and the emergence of the World Wide Web—when they entered the mainstream of public life. The texts are by computer scientists, artists, architects, literary writers, interface designers, cultural critics, and individuals working across disciplines. The contributors include (chronologically) Jorge Luis Borges, Vannevar Bush, Alan Turing, Ivan Sutherland, William S. Burroughs, Ted Nelson, Italo Calvino, Marshall McLuhan, Jean Baudrillard, Nicholas Negroponte, Alan Kay, Bill Viola, Sherry Turkle, Richard Stallman, Brenda Laurel, Langdon Winner, Robert Coover, and Tim Berners-Lee. The CD accompanying the book contains examples of early games, digital art, independent literary efforts, software created at universities, and home-computer commercial software. Also on the CD is digitized video, documenting new media programs and artwork for which no operational version exists. One example is a video record of Douglas Engelbart's first presentation of the mouse, word processor, hyperlink, computer-supported cooperative work, video conferencing, and the dividing up of the screen we now call non-overlapping windows; another is documentation of Lynn Hershman's Lorna, the first interactive video art installation.

1610391845,"A groundbreaking new theory of the real rules of politics: leaders do whatever keeps them in power, regardless of the national interest.     As featured on the viral video Rules for Rulers, which has been viewed over 3 million times.     Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith's canonical book on political science turned conventional wisdom on its head. They started from a single assertion: Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. They don't care about the ""national interest""-or even their subjects-unless they have to.     This clever and accessible book shows that democracy is essentially just a convenient fiction. Governments do not differ in kind but only in the number of essential supporters, or backs that need scratching. The size of this group determines almost everything about politics: what leaders can get away with, and the quality of life or misery under them. The picture the authors paint is not pretty. But it just may be the truth, which is a good starting point for anyone seeking to improve human governance. Mehr lesen",200

This book is about their struggles in the area now known as Nigeria that led to the formation of the Royal Niger Company Chartered and Limited with its private army in 1886, the takeover of the Company by Lever Brothers Ltd in 1920 and its amalgamation in 1929 with its rival, the African and Eastern Trade Co-operation to form the United Africa Company, which then became the largest trading organization of its type in West Africa, if not in the world.  Obviously, the old trading methods of Nigeria had to give way eventually, not only to more modern techniques, but also to the pressures of national independence, and so the book is finished by recording the affairs of the latter day agents and managers as they diversified the Company's activities and restructured its establishment until by 1971, when the book ends, it had been able to sell off its large river fleet, which had been for so long the backbone of its enterprise in Nigeria, but was now redundant, and yet still remain the leading commercial conglomerate in both Nigeria and West Africa.",200

1472808932,"When Italy surrendered in 1943, it sparked a diverse resistance movement of anti-German, anti-fascist partisans who rose up against German occupation. This book explores the tactics, organizational structure and equipment of the brave Italian resistance fighters, who knew exactly what was at stake when operating against their German occupiers. Beginning with low-level sabotage and assassinations, the groups grew until spring 1944 when they numbered around 100,000, and as the Allies advanced to the Gothic line, a remarkable, unified partisan command structure was created. The partisans began to work in close co-ordination with the Allies, receiving British SOE and American OSS liaison teams as well as supplies of weapons. The German response was eye-watering in its ferocity and brutality, as the SS and Italian RSI looked to eradicate the partisans once and for all when the Allied advance stalled in Autumn 1944. But when the Allies made their final breakthrough in the last weeks of the war the partisans rose in force to pile the pressure on the retreating Wehrmacht.  From an expert on Italian military history in World War II, this work provides an exhaustively researched, sumptuously illustrated guide to the men and women who fought a desperate struggle against occupation, as well as the German and Italian fascist security forces unleashed against them.",200

This volume brings together leading international carnivore researchers to explore the unique biological and ecological issues associated with mammalian carnivores in urban landscapes.

Thousands of birders visit the country each year to enjoy Belize's amazing abundance and variety of both temperate and tropical birds in natural habitats that remain largely unspoiled.

0262026775,"A comprehensive guide to distributed algorithms that emphasizes examples and exercises rather than mathematical argumentation. This book offers students and researchers a guide to distributed algorithms that emphasizes examples and exercises rather than the intricacies of mathematical models. It avoids mathematical argumentation, often a stumbling block for students, teaching algorithmic thought rather than proofs and logic. This approach allows the student to learn a large number of algorithms within a relatively short span of time. Algorithms are explained through brief, informal descriptions, illuminating examples, and practical exercises. The examples and exercises allow readers to understand algorithms intuitively and from different perspectives. Proof sketches, arguing the correctness of an algorithm or explaining the idea behind fundamental results, are also included. An appendix offers pseudocode descriptions of many algorithms. Distributed algorithms are performed by a collection of computers that send messages to each other or by multiple software threads that use the same shared memory. The algorithms presented in the book are for the most part classics, selected because they shed light on the algorithmic design of distributed systems or on key issues in distributed computing and concurrent programming.

1590309898,"This collection of parables written by an eighteenth-century samurai is a classic of martial arts literature. The tales are concerned with themes such as perception of conflict, self-transformation, the cultivation of chi (life energy), and understanding yin and yang. Some of the parables seem light and fanciful, but they offer the reader valuable lessons on the fundamental principles of the martial arts; “The Mysterious Technique of the Cat” is iconic.  The “demon” in the title story refers to the mythical tengu, who guard the secrets of swordsmanship. A swordsman travels to Mt. Kurama, famous for being inhabited by tengu, and in a series of conversations he learns about mushin (no-mind), strategy, the transformation of chi, and how the path of the sword leads to the understanding of life itself.  The author, Issai Chozanshi, had a deep understanding of Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto, as well as insight into the central role of chi in the universe—points that are succinctly explained in William Scott Wilson’s fine introduction and extensive endnotes.

1498522114,"Reinterpreting a Native American Identity discusses the ongoing and morphing politics behind the federal government’s denial of full Lumbee tribal recognition. At the core of the Lumbee struggle for federal recognition are issues of cultural authenticity, racism, misrecognition, and assimilation grounded in a longer history of colonialism. Beyond merely describing why denial has continually occurred, this booktakes an American Indian Studies approach through the use of the Peoplehood Model developed by Tom Holm et al as a way of arguing for a better and more consistent recognition process grounded in Indigenous methodology and worldview. The Peoplehood Model is juxtaposed with the Western Colonial Model, the process that describes efforts to assimilate another culture. This bookcenters on the four aspects of Peoplehood—language, sacred history, territory/place, and ceremonial cycle—and shows how these interrelated concepts inform the Lumbee identity and worldview vis-à-vis the federal government’s longstanding refusal to fully recognize the tribe. The government’s arguments, derived from the Western Colonial Model, are countered and challenged by Lumbee-centered knowledge and history regarding identity within a syncretistic system of survival as an Indigenous group.  This study illustrates that the tribe’s indigenous language has not been fully lost to assimilation, as the federal government argues, but that Lumbee English is marked by linguistic adaptation, which retains a Native American worldview in use and meaning. It further demonstrates that the Lumbee have maintained a sacred history and revere their homeland as the “promised land,” contrary to the position periodically espoused by the federal government. Lastly, this book argues that the system used to restrict Native American religion harkens back to Roman Law, adopted through the writings of Thomas Aquinas, later synthesized by Dominican theologian Franciscus de Victoria and eventually elevated to papal hierocratic ideology adopted by many colonizing countries. While Lumbee religion is Christian-centric, it is also intertwined with Indigenous spiritual and healing practices which are not subsumed by Christianity but are placed as equally valid within a spiritual system.

Fueled by this glimmer of hope, the Companions band together to uncover the truth behind the gods' absence—though they aren't the only ones with an interest in the staff. The Seekers, a new religious order, wants the artifact for their own ends, believing it will help them replace the gods and overtake the continent of Ansalon. Now, the Companions must assume the unlikely roles of heroes if they hope to prevent the staff from falling into the hands of darkness.  Mehr lesen",200
8185107378,"For three years in the early 1970s, women from different castes and classes came together in Bombay to wage a sustained battle against rising prices. The anti-price rise movement (APRM) took even the leaders of socialist and communist parties - of which many of the women were a part - by surprise. People hailed the movement as the new women's movement, the media gave the protesting women and their chosen symbols - the rolling pin, the tin of ghee, the kitchen ladle - wide coverage. Spearheading the action, the Mahngai Pratikar Samjukta Mahila Samiti, a joint front of women from different political groups, led raids on traders, inspected ration shops, and fought to have hoarded goods released. In 1975, the declaration of a state of emergency brought this vibrant movement to an abrupt halt. This book traces the nature of women's political participation and militancy in the APRM, and relates it to their everyday experiences within the context of the broader political scene in India in the 1970s. It documents the movement and examines its genesis, its forms of protest, its structure and method of organization and raises key questions about our understanding of particular movements and their relevance to political practice.",200

0310326273,"How did one man's unshakable faith shape the future of thousands struggling to break free from the grip of addiction, poverty, and sin? Join Gary Wilkerson as he shares a never-before-seen look at the incredible life and legacy of his father, bestselling author and evangelist David Wilkerson. This book tells the story of David Wilkerson, a man who refused to give up on those on the streets even when they had given up on themselves, and who saw in the eyes of drug addicts and gang members what others failed to see--the unconditional love of Jesus Christ. But who was David Wilkerson? When Wilkerson moved to New York from rural Pennsylvania in 1958 to confront the gangs who ran the streets, he was a skinny, 120-pound man. After the initial publicity that brought him face to face with some of the most dangerous young men in the city, he largely flew under the radar of the media, using the Word of God and a bit of tough love to help men and women of the street escape the destructive spiral of drugs and violence. Wilkerson was always the real deal, full of passion and conviction, not interested in what others said was the ""right"" thing to do. An evangelist both in America and overseas, David authored books that inspired people to be serious about their relationship with Christ. His financial generosity reached around the globe, providing homes for the destitute and feeding programs for the hungry. When he founded the Times Square Church in 1987, his ministry impacted more lives than he ever dreamed possible. Mehr lesen",200

1620553686,"Reveals how Christian mythology has more to do with long-standing pagan traditions than the Bible  • Explains how the church fathers knowingly incorporated pagan elements into the Christian faith to ease the transition to the new religion  • Identifies pagan deities that were incorporated into each of the saints  • Shows how all the major holidays in the Christian calendar are modeled on pagan rituals and myths, including Easter and Christmas  In this extensive study of the Christian mythology that animated Europe in the Middle Ages, author Philippe Walter reveals how these stories and the holiday traditions connected with them are based on long-standing pagan rituals and myths and have very little connection to the Bible. The author explains how the church fathers knowingly incorporated pagan elements into the Christian faith to ease the transition to the new religion. Rather than tear down the pagan temples in Britain, Pope Gregory the Great advised Saint Augustine of Canterbury to add the pagan rituals into the mix of Christian practices and transform the pagan temples into churches. Instead of religious conversion, it was simply a matter of convincing the populace to include Jesus in their current religious practices.  Providing extensive documentation, Walter shows which major calendar days of the Christian year are founded on pagan rituals and myths, including the high holidays of Easter and Christmas. Examining hagiographic accounts of the saints, he reveals the origin of these symbolic figures in the deities worshipped in pagan Europe for centuries. He also explores how the identities of saints and pagan figures became so intermingled that some saints were transformed into pagan incarnations, such as Mary Magdalene’s conversion into one of the Celtic Ladies of the Lake.  In revealing the pagan roots of many Christian figures, stories, and rituals, Walter provides a new understanding of the evolution of religious belief. Mehr lesen",200

1566992885,"A second edition of Memories, Hopes, and Conversations is now available! With helpful updates throughout, the new edition features five new chapters on Appreciative Inquiry applied in real congregations.  When First Presbyterian Church in Altadena, California, was asked to provide a mission study report for its pastor nominating committee, the congregation was afraid they would find themselves engaging in busy work and producing a report that would wind up in a file gathering dust. They then asked professor Mark Lau Branson to consult with them on writing this report. He invited them to join in a process of Appreciative Inquiry--a transformational organization change process--which resulted in a major shift in congregational conversations and a new sense of hope. Memories, Hopes, and Conversations recounts the experience of First Presbyterian and outlines a process that any congregation can utilize to harness the energies of the congregation at all levels of its common life. Branson first leads readers through the foundations of Appreciative Inquiry and bracingly explores biblical texts for understanding the practice in a faith context. He then outlines and illustrates a four-step process--Initiate, Inquire, Imagine, Innovate--that creatively employs constructive conversations and questions to evoke storytelling and spur imaginations. Branson persuasively demonstrates how concentrating on needs and problems can mire a congregation in discouragement and distract it from noticing innate strengths. By focusing on memories of the congregation at its best, members are able to construct ""provocative proposals"" to help shape the church’s future. Grounded in solid theory and real-life practice, Memories, Hopes, and Conversations is a groundbreaking work of narrative leadership and the first book to apply the principles of Appreciative Inquiry to the lives of congregations.

On May 15, 2010, after 210 days at sea and more than 22,000 nautical miles, 16-year-old Jessica Watson sailed her 33-foot boat triumphantly back to land. She had done it. She was the youngest person to sail solo, unassisted, and nonstop around the world.  Jessica spent years preparing for this moment, years focused on achieving her dream.

0442233981,"Within the past decade there has been a veritable explosion of interest in the relationship between food and human behavior. It seems that there is an insatiable desire to find connections between what we eat and what we do. A clear example of this is the proliferation of books, magazine and newspaper articles, and television and radio programs devoted to the topic. More important, however, is the increased attention the scientific community is giving to the study of nutrition and behavior as evidenced by the growth of research, the development of undergraduate and graduate programs, and the number of scientific conferences addressing the prob lems in this area. The burgeoning scientific interest in this field makes it a very appropriate time for this book. The principal goal of Nutrition and Behavior: New Perspectives is to provide a comprehensive examination of the scientific evidence dealing with relationships between nutritional variables and behavior. Although findings in research using experimental animals will be introduced, the primary emphasis will be on investigating the nutrition-behavior relation ship in our own species. The first chapter provides a historical introduction to the area and examines the techniques used in the scientific assessment of nutrition and behavior. This material gives the reader the necessary background to place recent research on nutrition and behavior within a wider perspective and to evaluate its reliability and validity.""",200

For thirty years, Lynn Wilder, once a tenured faculty member at Brigham Young University, and her family lived in, loved, and promoted the Mormon Church. Then their son Micah, serving his Mormon mission in Florida, had a revelation: God knew him personally. God loved him. And the Mormon Church did not offer the true gospel. Micah's conversion to Christ put the family in a tailspin. They wondered, Have we believed the wrong thing for decades? If we leave Mormonism, what does this mean for our safety, jobs, and relationships? Is Christianity all that different from Mormonism anyway?

0674022874,"Walter Benjamin's essays on the great French lyric poet Charles Baudelaire revolutionized not just the way we think about Baudelaire, but our understanding of modernity and modernism as well. In these essays, Benjamin challenges the image of Baudelaire as late-Romantic dreamer, and evokes instead the modern poet caught in a life-or-death struggle with the forces of the urban commodity capitalism that had emerged in Paris around 1850. The Baudelaire who steps forth from these pages is the flâneur who affixes images as he strolls through mercantile Paris, the ragpicker who collects urban detritus only to turn it into poetry, the modern hero willing to be marked by modern life in its contradictions and paradoxes. He is in every instance the modern artist forced to commodify his literary production: ""Baudelaire knew how it stood with the poet: as a flâneur he went to the market; to look it over, as he thought, but in reality to find a buyer."" Benjamin reveals Baudelaire as a social poet of the very first rank.  The introduction to this volume presents each of Benjamin's essays on Baudelaire in chronological order. The introduction, intended for an undergraduate audience, aims to articulate and analyze the major motifs and problems in these essays, and to reveal the relationship between the essays and Benjamin's other central statements on literature, its criticism, and its relation to the society that produces it.",200

0816518459,"Once hunted by whalers and now the darling of ecotourists, the gray whale has become part of the culture, history, politics, and geography of Mexico's most isolated region. After the harvesting of gray whales was banned by international law in 1946, their populations rebounded; but while they are no longer hunted for their oil, these creatures are now chased up and down the lagoons of southern Baja California by whalewatchers.This book uses the biology and politics associated with gray whales in Mexican waters to present an unusual case study in conservation and politics. It provides an inside look at how gray whale conservation decisions are made in Mexico City and examines how those policies and programs are carried out in the calving grounds of San Ignacio Lagoon and Magdalena Bay, where catering to ecotourists is now an integral part of the local economy.  More than a study of conservation politics, Dedina's book puts a human face on wildlife conservation. The author lived for two years with residents of Baja communities to understand their attitudes about wildlife conservation and Mexican politics, and he accompanied many in daily activities to show the extent to which the local economy depends on whalewatching.""It is ironic,"" observes Dedina, ""that residents of some of the most isolated fishing villages in North America are helping to redefine our relationship with wild animals. Americans and Europeans brought the gray whale population to the brink of extinction. The inhabitants of San Ignacio Lagoon and Magdalena Bay are helping us to celebrate the whales' survival.""

0691164185,"A bold new conceptualization of Islam that reflects its contradictions and rich diversity  What is Islam? How do we grasp a human and historical phenomenon characterized by such variety and contradiction? What is ""Islamic"" about Islamic philosophy or Islamic art? Should we speak of Islam or of islams? Should we distinguish the Islamic (the religious) from the Islamicate (the cultural)? Or should we abandon ""Islamic"" altogether as an analytical term?  In What Is Islam?, Shahab Ahmed presents a bold new conceptualization of Islam that challenges dominant understandings grounded in the categories of ""religion"" and ""culture"" or those that privilege law and scripture. He argues that these modes of thinking obstruct us from understanding Islam, distorting it, diminishing it, and rendering it incoherent.  What Is Islam? formulates a new conceptual language for analyzing Islam. It presents a new paradigm of how Muslims have historically understood divine revelation―one that enables us to understand how and why Muslims through history have embraced values such as exploration, ambiguity, aestheticization, polyvalence, and relativism, as well as practices such as figural art, music, and even wine drinking as Islamic. It also puts forward a new understanding of the historical constitution of Islamic law and its relationship to philosophical ethics and political theory.

The book is structured so that it can be read in a variety of ways—as a historically developed narrative of modern architecture in Latin America, as a country-specific chronology, or as a treatment of traditions centered on issues of art, technology, or utopia. This structure allows readers to see the development of multiple and parallel branches/historical strands of architecture and, at times, their interconnections across countries. The authors provide a critical evaluation of the movements presented in relationship to their overall goals and architectural transformations. Mehr lesen",200

0199744394,"In The Oxford Book of American Short Stories, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of nearly sixty tales that combines classic works with many ""different, unexpected"" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers.  Some selections simply can't be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving's ""Rip Van Winkle"" and Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart."" But alongside these often-anthologized tales, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain's ""Cannibalism in the Cars,"" a work that reveals a darker side to his humor. From Melville come the juxtaposed tales ""The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,"" of which Oates says, ""only Melville could have fashioned out of 'real' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction."" The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Langston Hughes, to Ray Bradbury, H.P. Lovecraft, and Stephen King.  For the second edition, Oates has introduced a wide range of new stories from writers who represent the state of American literature today. These new works include Lorrie Moore's ""How to Become a Writer,"" Richard Ford's ""Under the Radar,"" Junot Diaz's ""Edison, New Jersey,"" David Foster Wallace's ""Good People,"" Philip Roth's ""Defender of the Faith,"" and Amy Hempel's ""Today Will Be a Quiet Day."" As in the original volume, Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work. In addition, she has written a new preface that contemplates our shifting literary culture, and has revised her introductory essay to the first edition, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master.

Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-reading robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world—all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asimov’s trademark.   The Three Laws of Robotics: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. 3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov formulated the laws governing robots’ behavior. In  Mehr lesen",200

So begins life in the United States for many people every day. And so begins this collection of twelve autobiographical stories by Santa Clara University professor Francisco Jiménez, who at the age of four illegally crossed the border with his family in 1947. ""The Circuit,"" the story of young Panchito and his trumpet, is one of the most widely anthologized stories in Chicano literature. At long last, Jiménez offers more about the wise, sensitive little boy who has grown into a role model for subsequent generations of immigrants.

1590560442,"Revered as a symbol of fertility, sexuality, purity and childhood, beloved as a children’s pet and widely represented in the myths, art and collectibles of almost every culture, the rabbit is one of the most popular animals known to humans. Ironically, it has also been one of the most misunderstood and abused. Indeed, the rabbit is the only animal that our culture adores as a pet, idolizes as a storybook hero and slaughters for commercial purposes. Stories Rabbits Tell takes a comprehensive look at the rabbit as a wild animal, ancient symbol, pop culture icon, commercial “product” and domesticated pet. In so doing, the book explores how one species can be simultaneously adored as a symbol of childhood (think Peter Rabbit), revered as a symbol of female sexuality (e.g., Playboy Bunnies), dismissed as a “dumb bunny” in domesticity and loathed as a pest in the wild. The authors counter these stereotypes with engaging analyses of real rabbit behavior, drawn both from the authors' own experience and from academic studies, and place those behaviors in the context of current debates about animal consciousness. In a detailed investigative section, the authors also describe conditions in the rabbit meat, fur, pet and vivisection industries, and raise important questions about the ethics of treating rabbits as we do. The first book of its kind, Stories Rabbits Tell provides invaluable information and insight into the life and history of an animal whom many love, but whom most of us barely know. As such, it is a key addition to the current thinking on animal emotions, intelligences and welfare, and the way that human perceptions influence the treatment of individual species. Mehr lesen",200

1440832390,"By examining the history of the legal regulation of union actions, this fascinating book offers a new interpretation of American labor-law policy―and its harmful impact on workers today.  Arguing that the decline in union membership and bargaining power is linked to rising income inequality, this important book traces the evolution of labor law in America from the first labor-law case in 1806 through the passage of right-to-work legislation in Michigan and Indiana in 2012. In doing so, it shares important insights into economic development, exploring both the nature of work in America and the part the legal system played―and continues to play―in shaping the lives of American workers.  The book illustrates the intertwined history of labor law and politics, showing how these forces quashed unions in the 19th century, allowed them to flourish in the mid-20th century, and squelched them again in recent years. Readers will learn about the negative impact of union decline on American workers and how that decline has been influenced by political forces. They will see how the right-to-work and Tea Party movements have combined to prevent union organizing, to the detriment of the middle class. And they will better understand the current failure to reform labor law, despite a consensus that unions can protect workers without damaging market efficiencies. Mehr lesen",200
0306822326,"The day after Thanksgiving, five months into the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur flew to American positions in the north and grandly announced an end-the-war-by-Christmas offensive, despite recent evidence of intervention by Mao's Chinese troops. Marching north in plunging temperatures, General Edward Almond's X Corps, which included a Marine division under the able leadership of General Oliver Smith, encountered little resistance. But thousands of Chinese, who had infiltrated across the frozen Yalu River, were lying in wait and would soon trap tens of thousands of US troops.  Led by the Marines, an overwhelmed X Corps evacuated the frigid, mountainous Chosin Reservoir vastness and fought a swarming enemy and treacherous snow and ice to reach the coast. Weather, terrain, Chinese firepower, and a 4,000-foot chasm made escape seem impossible in the face of a vanishing Christmas. But endurance and sacrifice prevailed, and the last troopships weighed anchor on Christmas Eve.  In the tradition of his Silent Night and Pearl Harbor Christmas, Stanley Weintraub presents another gripping narrative of a wartime Christmas season.  Mehr lesen",200

1406720577,"PRELIMINARY NOTICE. MR. FURNIVALL, at p. 12 of the Eleventh Report of the Com mittee of the Early English Text Society September, 1879, says as follows On Prof. Skeats receiving, to the Committees great pleasure, his well-earned and well-deserved reward of the Anglo- Saxon Professorship at Cambridge, he proposed that the Society should autotype the unique MS. of the great Anglo-Saxon epic of Beowulf. The Committee, relying on finding a translator and editor of the- text, adopted Prof. Skeats suggestion. The MS. was photographed by Mr. Praetorius he has delivered some of the autotypes, and undertakes to hand in the whole early next year. Part I. of the book is now in hand, and will be issued for 1880 in 1881. Before that Report was printed, I had promised Mr. Furnivall to act as editor. I collated the autotypes in the August and September of 1880, with the MS. as well as with the two transcripts of it, made nearly a hundred years ago the one by, the other for, the first editor of the poem, G. J. Thorkelin which now belong to the Large Royal Library at Copenhagen, but which, on our directors application, were kindly sent to the British Museum. After my return to Germany, however, having to perform the duties of Dean to the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Berlin for 1880- 1881, I was unable to go on with the Beoufrilf before the long vacation of 1881. My transliteration of the MS. was in type by the end of August, 1882, and I read the proof-sheets of it with the MS. in the earlier part of the following month. The transliteration contains more than can be read in the Facsimile or even in the MS., inasmuch as it has been my endeavour to give the text as far as possible in that condition in which it stood in the MS. a century ago. The MS. Cotton MSS. Vitellius A. xv. did not suffer so much from the fire of 1731 itself as from its consequences, which would, without doubt, have been avoided if the MS. had been at once rebound as carefully as it has been rebound in our days. Even when Thorkelin used it, the edges of a few pages only had crumbled off. But much morewas gone by Kembles time, and many letters and words which Kemble still saw are now no longer in existence. Further losses have been put a stop to by the new binding but, admirably as this was done, the binder could not help covering some letters or portions of letters in every back page with the edge of the paper which now surrounds every parchment leaf. I grudged no pains in trying to decipher as much of what is covered as possible. When, in my notes, I simply state that something is covered, I always mean to say that, by holding the leaf to the light, I was able to read it nevertheless. In case I could not make out what is covered distinctly, I always add a remark to that effect. Both in the front pages and in the back pages transparent paper was employed by the binder, which, although it does not prevent the reader of the MS... Mehr lesen",200

See what the experts say about Thomas Horn’s Business Valuation Manual:  “Takes the confusion out of finding the dollar value of a business. Takes the established methods used by experts and breaks them down into easy-to-understand, well-defined steps. Designed for both the professional and the non-expert, this book should appeal to business owners, manager, accountants, attorneys, lenders, business brokers, investment bankers, investors, business buyers, and business sellers.” - THE NATIONAL PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT  “Gives the basics on such tried-and-true methods as the discounted cash flow method, capitalization of income stream, and excess earnings method. Although these technical sounding terms may scare anyone off but accountants, Horn’s book is well-organized and easy to understand. After an introduction that provides a detailed list of the information needed and how to get it, readers can skip to whichever techniques best fit their needs.” - REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE, FINANCIAL ADVISORS EDITION  “This book is by far the best in making business valuation understandable to the average informed reader… a joy to read.” - THE REAL ESTATE APPRAISER & ANALYST  “A nifty little book…. Not meant to be read cover-to-cover…. Well worth its low cost and worth keeping as a quick reference handbook.” - INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BROKERS ASSOCIATION  “A useful, amusingly written, yet technically complete guide to calculating the value of a business.” - REAL ESTATE FINANCE TODAY  “Down-to-earth advice. A how-to manual, straightforward and clearly written.” - CHANGING TIMES  “If you are asked by a business owner to value his business, you might be well-advised to read this book before going to more sophisticated methods.” - MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING  “A good guide through the murky waters, providing a straightforward volume with a useful glossary.” - HIGH TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS  “It’s put together into a coherent whole so beautifully and it’s so easy to understand that it’s a joy to read.” - THE REAL ESTATE APPRAISER  “Worth Reading. Recommended for anyone interested in evaluating the worth of their business.” - TURNAROUNDS & WORKOUTS  “You don’t have to be a financial genius to use it. The results can help you negotiate the sale of your business, decide whether an acquisition is feasible, and aid in estate planning.” - REAL ESTATE TODAY  “Unless you have a strong financial background, the language of business valuation can sound like some obscure dialect. For our money, the best primer is Thomas Horn’s business valuation manual. Horn walks you through the process of valuing a business: when to undertake the job, how precise you need to be, how to gather and prepare the data. A glossary and occasional cartoons demystify the subject without trivializing it. Is the book oversimplified? There’s no danger of that, according to Michael J. Roberts, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School. ‘Horn explains the most common approaches to valuation and how to perform those analyses,’ he says. ‘He also shows you how to adjust your financial statements accordingly.’ The book, Roberts adds, is useful even for company owners who have no intention of selling. ‘It can be very helpful to look at your company as a potential purchaser would. It can show you where the real sources of value are and where the real potential to improve is.” - INC. MAGAZINE  “Makes appraising a company as straightforward as balancing the checkbook. What? You’re not a CPA you say? No trouble there. Horn’s manual, believe it or not, is laid out in plain language. What financial lingo you aren’t familiar with is listed in a complete glossary.” - THE BUSINESS JOURNAL  “The easy-to-read, step-by-step explanations can be used by anyone to save themselves thousands of dollars in appraisal fees. The manual begins by outlining what type of information one must obtain during the evaluation process and how to go about getting it. It then goes on to present a breakdown of seven different valuation methods including guidance as to when each method should be used. Finally, the book explores how to most effectively apply the results of these calculations” - OBER INCOME LETTER  “Horn’s book is extremely well-organized and easy to understand. Readers can skip to whatever techniques best fit their needs.” - PERSONAL INVESTOR Magazine  “A book to help owners and managers increase the value of their business and measure it easily at any point in time. If you’re pressed for time, four of the book’s 25 chapters can be used to succinctly deliver value. One five-page chapter provides information on how to quickly increase the value of your business.” - INDUSTRY WEEK GROWING COMPANIES EDITION  “This book gives you results as good as any expert’s and saves you thousands on expensive appraisals because you do it yourself. No special financial knowledge needed – you just open the book and use it right away. Everything is broken down and explained in plain English, without technical mumbo-jumbo. This book belongs on the desk of every business owner.” - INCOME OPPORTUNITIES  “Initiated as an in-house manual for the author’s mergers-and-acquisitions firm, this book shows executives how to price their companies by analyzing cash flows, income streams, excess earnings, and so on. The book breaks down the most common valuation methods into non-technical steps. Extremely valuable when talking to bankers and investors or when handling a potential acquirer.” - MANAGEMENT REVIEW  “A book to help owners and managers increase the value of their business and measure it easily at any point in time. If you’re pressed for time, four of the book’s 25 chapters can be used to succinctly deliver value. One five-page chapter provides information on how to quickly increase the value of your business.” - INDUSTRY WEEK GROWING COMPANIES EDITION  “It is an understandable, step-by-step guide to placing a value on a business.” - NATION’S BUSINESS  “Suggested reading on the ins and outs of buying and selling a business.” - SUCCESS Magazine.  “The author provides personal advice on evaluating a company, deciding whether it should be bought, and the price at which a business transaction can really be accomplished. If you are asked by a business owner to value his business, you might be well-advised to read this book before going to more sophisticated methods.” - MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING  “The bottom line is only one way to measure how a company is doing... A useful exercise even if the firm isn’t for sale.” - INDUSTRY WEEK  “Provides information on what data to gather for an evaluation, which methods are best in a given case, what pitfalls to avoid, and how to use the evaluation for acquisition pricing, financing strategies, negotiation, and identifying strengths and weaknesses of the company.” - THE FINANCIAL MANAGER, The Magazine for Financial and Accounting Professionals  “A book to help owners and managers increase the value of their business and measure it easily at any point in time.

0393082571,"The vivid history of Beale Street―a lost world of swaggering musicians, glamorous madams, and ruthless politicians―and the battle for the soul of Memphis. Following the Civil War, Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, thrived as a cauldron of sex and song, violence and passion. But out of this turmoil emerged a center of black progress, optimism, and cultural ferment. Preston Lauterbach tells this vivid, fascinating story through the multigenerational saga of a family whose ambition, race pride, and moral complexity indelibly shaped the city that would loom so large in American life. Robert Church, who would become “the South’s first black millionaire,” was a mulatto slave owned by his white father. Having survived a deadly race riot in 1866, Church constructed an empire of vice in the booming river town. He made a fortune with saloons, gambling, and―shockingly―white prostitution. But he also nurtured the militant journalism of Ida B. Wells and helped revolutionize American music through the work of composer W.C. Handy, the man who claimed to have invented the blues. In the face of Jim Crow, the Church fortune helped fashion the most powerful black political organization of the early twentieth century. Robert and his son, Bob Jr., bought and sold property, founded a bank, and created a park and auditorium for their people finer than the places whites had forbidden them to attend. Mehr lesen",200

When Romeo Dallaire was called on to serve as force commander of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda, he believed that his assignment was to help two warring parties achieve the peace they both wanted.

The Mafia in Italian Lives and Literature explores the ways that these literary engagements with the mafia relate to broader contemporary Italian life and offer implicit challenges, and a quiet code of resistance, to the trauma and injustice wrought by the mafia in various Italian cities. Despite the long tradition of representing the mafia in Italian literature, until now women's contributions to this literature have been overlooked. Pickering-Iazzi's aim is to encourage new critical reflection on a broader selection of literature through new theoretical lenses in order to enrich our understanding of crime fiction, Sicily and Sicilian identity in literature, narrative traits of the new Italian epic, and the cultural and social functions of storytelling in life and literature.",200

050023843X,"The story of how this magnificent Islamic treasure was painstakingly reconstructed under the aegis of the Jordanian royal family.  Early one morning in August 1969 a firebomb was set off in the al-Aqsa mosque in the heart of one of the holiest places in Jerusalem. A devastating blaze soon engulfed the thousand-year-old building, severely damaging the interior.  When the firemen had put out the flames, a sodden pile of ashes was discovered, all that remained of one of the jewels of Islamic artthe Minbar of Saladin. An extraordinary piece of craftsmanship, the Minbar, or pulpit, had been installed by Saladin in the mosque on his triumphant recapture of Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. Made of 16,000 pieces of intricately carved wood, adorned with ivory and ebony, it was widely acknowledged as a pinnacle of Islamic design and woodcarving.  This book on the Minbar's reconstruction tells of the quest to fathom the principles of Islamic sacred geometry and to decipher how the Minbar's complex patterns were created. This was followed by a worldwide search for materials and for craftsmen who still possessed the necessary skillsskills that had seemed lost in today's world of mass production and modern technology.  The book also illustrates the work of the Prince of Wales's School of Traditional Arts in London and the College of Traditional Islamic Arts & Architecture in al-Salt, Jordan, where many of the crafts for which Islamic art and architecture are celebrated are being revived.

155643572X,"George Robert Stowe Mead (1863-1933) was a major translator, editor, and commentator on Gnostic and hermetic literature and thus a pivotal figure linking the late 19th-century esoteric revival to 20th-century art, literature, and psychology. As a young convert to the new movement of theosophy, he served as private secretary to its co-founder, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and after founding the European section of the Theosophical Society edited its London journal, Lucifer, for many years. Mead's initial interest in theosophy and Hinduism soon blossomed into a lifelong and wide-ranging engagement with the texts of Gnosticism, neo-Platonism, and hermeticism. His editions and commentaries on previously inaccessible sources became standard works before the First World War and an important source of inspiration to such figures as Jung, Ezra Pound, Yeats, and Robert Duncan. A new entry in the Western Masters Series of concise biographies noting key figures in the Western esoteric tradition, G.R.S.

0393316823,"A brilliant book celebrating improbability as the engine that drives life, by the acclaimed author of The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker. The human eye is so complex and works so precisely that surely, one might believe, its current shape and function must be the product of design. How could such an intricate object have come about by chance? Tackling this subject―in writing that the New York Times called ""a masterpiece""―Richard Dawkins builds a carefully reasoned and lovingly illustrated argument for evolutionary adaptation as the mechanism for life on earth.  The metaphor of Mount Improbable represents the combination of perfection and improbability that is epitomized in the seemingly ""designed"" complexity of living things. Dawkins skillfully guides the reader on a breathtaking journey through the mountain's passes and up its many peaks to demonstrate that following the improbable path to perfection takes time. Evocative illustrations accompany Dawkins's eloquent descriptions of extraordinary adaptations such as the teeming populations of figs, the intricate silken world of spiders, and the evolution of wings on the bodies of flightless animals. And through it all runs the thread of DNA, the molecule of life, responsible for its own destiny on an unending pilgrimage through time.  Mehr lesen",200
1604135379,"Date rape drugs earn their name from the primary motivation for their use: to facilitate sexual assault against an unwitting victim. Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, and Rohypnol are the three main types of drugs referred to as date rape drugs, though alcohol is the most common drug used to facilitate date rape. Although each of these drugs differs in their effect on the body, they all act as sedatives, frequently causing unconsciousness and amnesia. Easily dissolved in liquids, a date rape drug placed in a victim's drink can be consumed unknowingly and render the victim unconscious. After the drugs wears off, amnesia about previous events increases the chances that the assailant is never caught.

1107411831,"In the 1990s and mid 2000s, turbulent political and social protests surrounded the issue of private sector involvement in providing urban water services in both the developed and developing world. Water on Tap explores examples of such conflicts in six national settings (France, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand), focusing on a central question: how were rights and regulation mobilised to address the demands of redistribution and recognition? Two modes of governance emerged: managed liberalisation and participatory democracy, often in hybrid forms that complicated simple oppositions between public and private, commodity and human right. The case studies examine the effects of transnational and domestic regulatory frameworks shaping the provision of urban water services, bilateral investment treaties and the contributions of non-state actors such as transnational corporations, civil society organisations and social movement activists. The conceptual framework developed can be applied to a wide range of transnational governance contexts.",200

0993191118,"CCCP Cook Book is an amazing work of culinary history. The book as an object is a marvel ... It’s my new ""You Must Buy This Book"" recommendation for my foodie friends."" –BoingBoing As the Soviet Union struggled along the path to communism, food shortages were commonplace, and both Party authorities and Soviet citizens had to apply every ounce of ingenuity to maximize often-inadequate resources. The stories and recipes contained in the CCCP Cook Book reflect these turbulent times: from basic subsistence meals consumed by the average citizen (like okroshka, a cold soup made with the fermented beverage kvass) to extravagant banquets held by the political elite (suckling pig with buckwheat), with a scattering of classics (beef stroganoff) in between. Each recipe is introduced with a historical story or anecdote from the period, and illustrated using images sourced from original Soviet recipe books collected by the authors, food historians Olga and Pavel Syutkin. Many of the sometimes extraordinary-looking pictures depict dishes whose recipes used unobtainable ingredients, placing them firmly in the realm of ""aspirational"" fantasy for the average Soviet household. In their content and presentation, the recipes and illustrations act as windows into the cuisine and culture of the era. CCCP Cook Book offers an illustrated history of Soviet cuisine told through the stories and popular recipes from the period. The book contains 60 recipes from the Soviet period, including such delicacies as aspic, borscht, caviar and herring, by way of bird's milk cake and pelmeni. Mehr lesen",200

It is a type of healing for the intellect and the heart.” - (Rebecca Lee) A lyrical and intimate account of how a poet, in the midst of a bad divorce, finds consolation and grace through viewing the paintings of Vermeer, in six world cities. In the midst of a divorce (in which the custody of his young daughter is at stake) and over the course of a year, the poet Michael White, travels to Amsterdam, The Hague, Delft, London, Washington, and New York to view the paintings of Johannes Vermeer, an artist obsessed with romance and the inner life.  He is astounded by how consoling it is to look closely at Vermeer’s women, at the artist’s relationship to his subjects, and at how composition reflects back to the viewer such deep feeling. Includes the author’s very personal study of Vermeer. Through these travels and his encounters with Vermeer’s radiant vision, White finds grace and personal transformation.

0199927707,"Osteoporosis is a common, underdiagnosed, and undertreated condition, complicated by fractures which lead to significant mortality and morbidity. The prevalence of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women exceeds the combined prevalence of breast cancer, stroke, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Often called ""the silent disease,"" it does not reveal itself with obvious symptoms until a fracture occurs. In the first year after sustaining a hip fracture, mortality is increased by almost 24% in women and is even higher in men. About half of those who sustain an osteoporotic hip fracture become so disabled that they are no longer able to resume their daily activities, and as many as 20% require long-term institutional care. Effective treatments for osteoporosis are now available if it is diagnosed and addressed in a timely manner. Unfortunately, this disease remains shockingly underdiagnosed and undertreated, even in patients who sustain low-trauma hip fractures. The past two decades have witnessed radical changes in the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis. The densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis is noninvasive, quick, and relatively simple. Tools are now available to predict the patient's probability of sustaining fractures, to identify patients who are particularly vulnerable, and to determine which patients will benefit from further investigation and treatment. Various associations have developed guidelines to help clinicians reach a diagnosis and initiate treatment. Due to better understanding of the basic pathophysiology of bone turnover, potent and relatively safe medications that significantly reduce the risk of fractures are now widely available. It is of paramount importance that this disease be diagnosed and treated as early as possible in order to take advantage of these developments and reduce the enormous socioeconomic and psychological impact of osteoporosis. Given the burden of osteoporotic fractures, all clinicians should have a working knowledge of e diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the disease. Clinicians should feel comfortable diagnosing and initiating treatment for the majority of patients with osteoporosis. Only complicated cases or patients who are unresponsive to treatment should be referred to specialists. The aim of this book is to distill the available information on osteoporosis into an easily comprehensible format that will serve as a practical guide for busy clinicians. Numerous boxes, tables, diagrams, and figures present the information in an accessible manner. This book will be of particular use to general practitioners, endocrinologists, rheumatologists, gynecologists, internists, geriatricians, and orthopedic surgeons. Mehr lesen",200

Vivid emotions that Will Higginbotham could not share with his men, instead, were shared in both prose and artistic sketches to his mother. Often penned in the stark aftermath or impending prelude to battle, this journal is a haunting and powerful tale of the struggle during wartime to do one's duty, yet to remain human. Higginbotham's hope was that this journal be used for good -- for veterans who need to know that they are not alone in their feelings and thoughts, for new soldiers who have not yet experienced war, and for families and friends of veterans who want to know what their soldier may have experienced. Dedicated to all veterans (past, present, and future), with special recognition to those who have given all and for those who have suffered battle wounds and scarring that may or may not be visible to the naked eye.  About the Author Sergeant William Henry Higginbotham III of the 173rd Airborne Combat Brigade, 2-503rd Scouts, was known affectionately as Higg or Hippie. After wartime, he wanted to be called Will.

Morison’s stirring intellectual exploration of the historical record proved to be an excellent starting point for my spiritual investigation."" --From the foreword by Lee Strobel English journalist Frank Morison had a tremendous drive to learn of Christ. The strangeness of the Resurrection story had captured his attention, and, influenced by skeptic thinkers at the turn of the century, he set out to prove that the story of Christ’s Resurrection was only a myth. His probings, however, led him to discover the validity of the biblical record in a moving, personal way. Who Moved the Stone? is considered by many to be a classic apologetic on the subject of the Resurrection. Morison includes a vivid and poignant account of Christ’s betrayal, trial, and death as a backdrop to his retelling of the climactic Resurrection itself. Among the chapter titles are: * The Book That Refused to Be Written * The Real Case Against the Prisoner * What Happened Before Midnight on Thursday * Between Sunset and Dawn * The Witness of the Great Stone * Some Realities of That Far-off Morning Who Moved the Stone? is a well-researched book that is as fascinating in its appeal to reason as it is accurate to the truthfulness of the Resurrection.",200

He is always on the move, never lingering in any one place long enough to risk being discovered. Still, there are certain places he returns to.

Unfortunately, the historically disputed lump of land called Leshp is once again floating directly between Ankh-Morpork and the city of Al-Khali on the coast of Klatch—which is spark enough to ignite that glorious international pastime called ""war."" Pressed into patriotic service, Commander Sam Vimes thinks he should be leading his loyal watchmen, female watchdwarf, and lady werewolf into battle against local malefactors rather than against uncomfortably well-armed strangers in the Klatchian desert. But war is, after all, simply the greatest of all crimes—and it's Sir Samuel's sworn duty to seek out criminal masterminds wherever they may be hiding and lock them away before they can do any real damage . . . even the ones on his side.",200

Written by a sword-drawing scholar, this volume describes the techniques and katas of Muso Shinden Ryu, one of iado's best-known schools. Many of the techniques and katas presented here have never before been available outside of the inner circle of the Muso Shinden Ryu school!

In addition, the sei tei kata (official forms) of the All-Japan Fencing Federation and the All-Japan Sword-Drawing Federation and described in detail.
